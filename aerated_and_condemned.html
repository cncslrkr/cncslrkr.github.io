        there's an aquarium i go to buy my food

        it stands out from the tesseation of homogeneous big box stores

        it is a simple pleasure to meander the isles 
        compared to the unwalkable streets and unremarkable light-industry

        its species richness is uncomputable realtive to the surroundant where the only ambulating animal life is carseat leather

        in its tanks are creachers from the benthic, the shoals, under rocks, and from schools
        it smells like an oldtimey dock far away from shore
        theres a troup of hard working people behind the counter happy to help
        it's fun to look at their scales, shales, shells, barbels, stalks, flecks, whiskers, and lateral lines

        they are made of math and infinite wonder
        when i divorce myself from reality its a beautiful escape
        the whole store is stocked fresh and bountiful and i allow myself to marvel and to be enchanted by the beautiful creachers
        it is a beautiful escape

        only,
        it is not that
        it is very different

        the creachers there are aerated and condemned
        each tanks life support system exists to support death
        
        the creachers are sensative
        staring out into florescence, acoustomed to near darkness

        creachers with ears that line the entierty of their bodies
        with apendages sufficient to navigate craggy total darkness
        are stuffed into boxes with ceasless unsteady pounding aeration

        they are sensitive
        and arrive dammaged from rough handling

        they too are killers, eat and be eaten where they are from
        but it makes little difference

        why must the only reprieve be of cruel nature
        my heart returns to the crack in the sidewalk collecting cigarette dust
